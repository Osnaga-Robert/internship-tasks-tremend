# Configurate the Linux environment

## Install the necessary packages

- apt update
- apt install dnsutils -> Press Y to confirm (for dig command)
- apt-get install -y iputils-ping (for ping command)
- apt-install vim -> Press Y to confirm, select the continent and the country you are from (for vim editor)
- apt-get install netcat-traditional (for nc command)
- apt install curl -> Press Y to confirm (for curl command)

## 1. Public IP for cloudfare.com

- dig cloudfare.com +short
- as a result, I got 2 IP addresses:
  - 104.16.133.229
  - 104.16.132.229

There are 2 IP addresses because cloudfare.com uses an anycast IP network\
that allows multiple seves to share the same IP address. So when I log in\
to cloudfare.com, I will be redirected to the nearest server.

## 2. Map IP addrress 8.8.8.8 to hostname google-dns

- vim /etc/hosts
- edit the file by pressing i
- Add the following line to the file:
- 8.8.8.8     google-dns
- exit and save the file :wq

## 3. Check if the DNS Port is Open for google-dns

- first check the DNS port number which is 53 (DNS basic port number)
- use nc -zv google-dns 53 to check if the port is open
  - z flag: scans for open ports
  - v flag: verbose, used for displaying more information

## 4. Modify the System to Use Google's public DNS

### 4.1 Change the nameserver to 8.8.8.8 instead of the default local configuration

- vim /etc/resolv.conf
- edit the file by pressing i
- change the nameserver to 8.8.8.8
- exit and save the file :wq
- check the modification by using cat /etc/resolv.conf

### 4.2 Perform another public IP lookup for cloudflare.com and compare the results

- dig cloudfare.com +short
- as a result, I got 2 IP addresses:
  - 188.114.96.3
  - 188.114.97.3

The IP addresses are different from the previous lookup because I changed\
the DNS server to google's public DNS so now the DNS server from google\
is used to resolve the IP addresses.

## 5. Install and verify that Nginx service is running 

- apt install nginx -> Press Y to confirm
- service nginx start -> to start the service
- service nginx status -> to check the status of the service (active)

## 6. Find the Listening Port for Nginx

- cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default | grep listen -> to find the listening port
- as a result, the listening port is 80
- ss -tuln | grep 80 -> to check if the port is open

## Bonus

### 1. Change the Nginx Listening port to 8080

- vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
- edit the file by pressing i
- change the listening port to 8080
- exit and save the file :wq
- service nginx restart -> to restart the service
- ss -tuln | grep 8080 -> to check if the port is open

### 2. Modify the default HTML page

- check the default HTML page using curl http://localhost:8080
- vim /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
- edit the file by pressing i
- change the title of the file
- exit and save the file :wq
- service nginx restart -> to restart the service
- open the browser and go to the IP address of the server with the port number
- use curl http://localhost:8080 to check the modification
